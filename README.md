# Seel

The idea of project Seel is to build an interactive system, focussing on a real world object, where the goal is that multiple people are able to interact with the object by simply moving around it.

Therefore we decided to use a pillar as object, supported by a tracking and projection system, so no additional controller would be needed to interact.Â  
For the interaction itself we've planned to develop.

a competitive version of the game "Breakout".
